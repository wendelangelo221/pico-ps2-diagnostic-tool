# 🎮🔍 Pico PS/2 Diagnostic Tool 🛠️🔗

Welcome to the **Pico PS/2 Diagnostic Tool** repository! This tool allows you to capture and replay signals on a PS/2 interface, specifically the DATA and CLOCK lines. By capturing a sequence of GPIO readings at short intervals, you can effectively log the entire timeline of PS/2 pin states during recording. Each capture can then be replayed, emulating the original signal.

## 📂 Repository Contents

Within this repository, you will find resources related to hardware, hardware hacking, Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), PS/2 keyboards, PS/2 protocol, PS/2 signal sniffers, signal capture, and signal reconstruction.
